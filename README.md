# shopper-cart
A simple React Shopping cart built in NextJS utilizing tailwindCSS.
- uses https://fakestoreapi.com/ for product data.

## Motivation 
I wanted to learn more about data fetching and how to display data on dynamic urls. Also the e-commerce development field is intriguing.

## What I Learned
- Context API can be used for managing global state
- Nextjs can dynamically generate urls very simply with getStaticPaths()
- filter array method is a good way to remove objects from a array
- you can only export one default function from a js file.
